This is an open source application for tracking activities on a weekly billing model and generating invoices via the Harvest API.

## Do you bill clients on a weekly rate?

We wrote Present because [test double](http://testdouble.com) bills (almost all) our clients on a weekly rate, but pretty much every T&E system only supports hourly billing. Our goal is to have a system to track our activity for generating invoices with a minimal amount of friction. The system also supports clients billed hourly.

A few features and aspects of the app:

* Weekly-rate projects, each entry tracking absence/half-day/full-day
* Hourly-rate projects, tracking numeric hours
* Biweekly billing cadence
* Users mark when their time is ready to be invoiced to their client(s)
* Lists invoices that need to be sent, along with any problems with the invoicing period's timesheets
* Generates invoices and sends them to Harvest
* Tracks location worked, each user with a default location that can be overridden for each entry
* Tracks holiday & vacation time

There are a few values hard-coded into the application specific to test double, but could otherwise be deployed and used by other organizations. If you're interested in using Present and would like to chat about it or see a demo of it in action, please get in touch with us [by e-mail](mailto:hello@testdouble.com)!

## Getting up and running

Do you work at Test Double? Congratulations! There is a really easy script to get you set up! Just run this:

```
$ ./script/setup
```

If you don't work at Test Double, here's some general advice to getting started:

### Prerequisites
- Ruby
- Postgres
- Harvest account _(for clients and invoicing)_
- GitHub OAuth application _(for access)_

### Setup


#### Environment

First copy the example environment file `.env.example` to `.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then update the variables with their corresponding values.

```bash
PRESENT_WEEKLY_RATE=""
PRESENT_HOURLY_RATE=""
PRESENT_ADMIN_GITHUB_IDS="username1,username2"
PRESENT_HARVEST_SUBDOMAIN=""
PRESENT_HARVEST_USERNAME=""
PRESENT_HARVEST_PASSWORD=""
```

#### Authentication

GitHub authentication is used to restrict access to only members belonging to a given GitHub Organization. [Register a new OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new); be sure to set the **authorization callback url** and **homepage url** correctly. For example, when running on _localhost_ these would be:

- Homepage URL: http://localhost:3000
- Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:3000/authorizations/github

Once created, update your GitHub **client id** and **client secret** to your environment along with the following required environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
PRESENT_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="blahblah982374dsblah"
PRESENT_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="blahas83828blahthelongerofthetwo"
PRESENT_GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_NAME="someorg"
```

### Running the application

Finally, you can go through a pretty standard Ruby dance of setting up a rails app:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

Start the server with the following:

```bash
bundle exec rails s
```

And then visit http://localhost:3000 in a browser.

### Backing and restoring from a heroku backup

If you need to debug with heroku data locally, you can do so with:

```
$ ./script/production_backup.sh
```

Then edit your "development" connection in `database.yml` to point to a database named "present_backup"

#### Running offline

Once you've set up at least one user in a database, you can work entirely offline by setting the `LOCAL_OVERRIDE_AS` environment variable to bypass the OAuth flow.

To run offline in development, you may:

```
$ LOCAL_OVERRIDE_AS="Justin Searls" rails s
```
